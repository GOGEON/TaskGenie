# Feature Specification: AI Task Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-task-generator`  
**Created**: 2025년 10월 19일 일요일  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "사용자가 '운동하기'와 같은 키워드를 제시하면 AI가 '준비 운동 5분', '스쿼트 3세트', '스트레칭 10분' 등과 같은 세부 할 일 항목들을 제시해주고, 사용자가 이를 체크할 수 있는 TO DO LIST 웹 애플리케이션을 구축해줘. 생성된 할 일은 저장되고 진행률을 시각적으로 확인할 수 있어야 해."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - AI-Generated To-Do List Creation (Priority: P1)

A user provides a keyword (e.g., "exercise") and the system generates a detailed, actionable to-do list (e.g., "5 minutes warm-up", "3 sets of squats", "10 minutes stretching").

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application, providing immediate value to the user by automating task generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by inputting a keyword and verifying that a relevant to-do list is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the user is on the application's main page, **When** the user enters "exercise" into the keyword input and submits, **Then** a list of exercise-related tasks is displayed.
2.  **Given** the user is on the application's main page, **When** the user enters "study" into the keyword input and submits, **Then** a list of study-related tasks is displayed.

### User Story 2 - To-Do Item Management (Priority: P1)

Users can check off completed items on their generated to-do list.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for tracking progress and interacting with the generated tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a list and marking an item as complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a to-do list is displayed with incomplete items, **When** the user clicks on a checkbox next to an item, **Then** the item is marked as complete.
2.  **Given** a to-do list is displayed with a completed item, **When** the user clicks on the checkbox next to the completed item, **Then** the item is marked as incomplete.

### User Story 3 - To-Do List Persistence (Priority: P2)

Generated to-do lists and their completion status are saved and can be retrieved later.

**Why this priority**: This ensures user progress is not lost and provides a continuous experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a list, marking items, closing and reopening the application, and verifying the list and status are preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user has generated and partially completed a to-do list, **When** the user closes and reopens the application, **Then** the previously generated list and its completion status are displayed.

---

### User Story 4 - Visual Progress Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users can visually see their progress on a to-do list.

**Why this priority**: This provides motivation and a clear overview of task completion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by marking items as complete and observing the visual representation of progress.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a to-do list with some items completed and some incomplete, **When** the user views the list, **Then** a progress indicator (e.g., a progress bar or percentage) accurately reflects the completion status.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI cannot generate relevant tasks for a given keyword?
- How does the system handle very long or very short generated task descriptions?
- What happens if the user tries to submit an empty keyword?
- The application should implement a combination of specific error messages, loading states, and empty states to provide comprehensive user feedback.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a keyword input from the user.
- **FR-002**: System MUST use AI to generate a list of detailed to-do items based on the provided keyword.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the generated to-do list to the user.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to mark individual to-do items as complete or incomplete.
- **FR-005**: System MUST save the generated to-do lists and their completion status.
- **FR-006**: System MUST retrieve and display previously saved to-do lists and their completion status.
- **FR-007**: System MUST visually represent the completion progress of a to-do list.
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle cases where the AI cannot generate relevant tasks for a given keyword by providing a user-friendly message.
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement user authentication and authorization for accessing saved to-do lists.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **To-Do List**: Represents a collection of tasks generated by the AI for a specific keyword.
-   **To-Do Item**: Represents a single, actionable task within a To-Do List, with a description and a completion status.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 90% of AI-generated to-do lists are relevant and actionable for the given keyword.
-   **SC-002**: Users can generate a to-do list within 5 seconds of submitting a keyword.
-   **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully mark items as complete and view their progress.
-   **SC-004**: Saved to-do lists and their completion status are accurately retrieved 100% of the time.

## Assumptions

-   **AI Service Availability**: It is assumed that an external AI service capable of generating relevant to-do items based on keywords will be available and integrated via direct SDK integration for a specific AI platform.
-   **Basic User Interface**: A standard web-based user interface is assumed for inputting keywords, displaying lists, and marking items.
-   **Data Storage**: A mechanism for persisting user data (to-do lists and their status) is assumed to be available.
